### 2. TODO

## Warship game

> Game board added as image.png

We all remember out beloved home game that
was able to be played on a sheet of paper.
Sooo lets make it happen :)

<p>This game should be done in the same fashion as the Tanks 
game, meaning no graphical interface, just interaction 
via console.</p>

> Break the task into multiple steps:
> 1) Place ships on the board, can be done by asking user for places to put ships or just place them at static locations
> 2) Make it possible to shoot
> 3) Register a shot and check if it hit anything
> 4) At the start you can hardcode player 2 moves, by the end try remove it and make a game so that you and someone else
     would be able to play it together with you OR at least so you would be able to register another player moves so you
     would have full picture and see what else to hit.
